# java9-module-refactoring
Code for Talk: Refactoring your code to Java 9 modules

Slides and Abstract on my website: http://rgra.github.io

Goal: Create two modular applications, one for a Vet and one for a Car Repair Shop.

Use the provided scripts to compile and run the applications.
Java 9 needs to be installed and the _JAVA9_ environment variable must point to the Java 9 /bin directory.

## de.rgra.vet_01

Initial code example with a simple JavaFX Application for a Vet.

## de.rgra.vet_02

Refactoring Step 1: Add Sub-Packages for technical layers

## de.rgra.vet_03

Refactoring Step 2: Creating Modules by splitting up the existing code

* model
* ui
* pet
* app

## de.rgra.vet_04

Refactoring Step 3: Resolving TODO in CustomerView with ServiceLoader

## de.rgra.vet_05

Refactoring Step 4: 
* Creating a general App Module
* Creating a new Car Module, similar to the Pet Module
* Resolving TODO in VisitDao
* Refactoring vet.app to use the general app 
* Creating car.app which references on the Car Module instead of the Pet module

This also adds a script for using the jlink to create platform specific standalone versions of the two applications.
